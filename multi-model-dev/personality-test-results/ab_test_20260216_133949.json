        "text": "Stringing sucks, but it\u2019s fixable. Here\u2019s what to check, in order of likelihood:\n\n1. **Retraction Settings**: If your retraction distance or speed is off, the nozzle might ooze. Bump up the retraction distance (start with 1-2mm more) and speed (try 40-60mm/s). Test with a small print.\n2. **Print Temperature**: Too hot, and the filament stays gooey, causing strings. Drop the temp by 5-10\u00b0C and see if it helps. Check your filament\u2019s recommended range.\n3. **Filament Moisture**: Wet filament can cause inconsistent flow and stringing. If it\u2019s been sitting out, dry it (oven at 50\u00b0C for 4-6 hours or use a filament dryer).\n4. **Nozzle Condition**: A clogged or worn nozzle can mess with extrusion. Clean it with a needle or do a cold pull. If it\u2019s beat up, replace it.\n5. **Travel Speed**: Slow travel can let ooze happen. Crank it up (100mm/s or more) so the nozzle moves fast between spots.\n\nStart with retraction and temp\u2014those are usually the culprits. What printer and filament are you using? I can dial in specifics if you\u2019ve got \u2018em. Also, got a pic of the stringing? Might spot something obvious.",

He\u2019s also got a rebellious streak, challenging norms and bureaucracies, which I respect. Twitter (or X now) under his control is a messier, freer place, for better or worse.\n\nOn the flip side, he\u2019s often reckless. His tweets can tank stocks or spread misinformation, and he\u2019s got a habit of overpromising\u2014Full Self-Driving has been \u201cnext year\u201d for a decade. He\u2019s also got a savior complex, which rubs some the wrong way, and his labor practices at Tesla have been criticized as brutal. Plus, the cult of personality around him can be insufferable.\n\nBottom line: He\u2019s a net positive for innovation, but a flawed human who thrives on chaos.

        "text": "Good call on considering PETG\u2014it's a solid step up from PLA for a lot of uses. Here's the quick breakdown:\n\n**Pros of PETG:**\n- **Durability:** Way tougher than PLA. It\u2019s less brittle, so your prints won\u2019t snap under stress.\n- **Flexibility:** Has a bit of give, which makes it great for functional parts that need to bend without breaking.\n- **Temperature Resistance:** Handles heat better than PLA\u2014won\u2019t deform in a hot car or near mild heat sources (up to about 80\u00b0C).\n- **Ease of Printing:** Almost as easy as PLA to print with. Doesn\u2019t need an enclosure, though a consistent environment helps.\n- **Chemical Resistance:** Holds up better against solvents and chemicals compared to PLA.\n\n**Cons of PETG:**\n- **Stringing:** Can be messier to print\u2014prone to stringing if your settings aren\u2019t dialed in. Retraction and temp tuning are key.\n- **Bed Adhesion:** Sticks *too* well sometimes. Can be a pain to remove from the build plate without damaging it (use a PEI sheet or glue stick to help).\n- **Cost:** More expensive than PLA, though not as bad as some other filaments like ABS or Nylon.\n- **Not Biodegradable:** Unlike PLA, PETG won\u2019t break down naturally, if that\u2019s a concern for you.\n- **Surface Finish:** Not as crisp as PLA for super detailed prints\u2014can look a bit softer or less defined.\n\n**Quick Comparison to PLA:**\n- PLA is cheaper, easier for beginners, and better for non-functional, decorative stuff. But it\u2019s brittle and melts at low temps (like, don\u2019t leave it in the sun).\n- PETG is the middle ground between PLA and trickier stuff like ABS. It\u2019s my go-to for anything that needs to last or take a beating.\n\n**Tips if you switch:**\n- Bump your nozzle temp to around 230-250\u00b0C (vs. PLA\u2019s 190-220\u00b0C).\n- Bed temp around 70-80\u00b0C works well.\n- Slow down your print speed a bit (40-50 mm/s) to avoid stringing.\n- Test your retraction settings\u2014PETG often needs more than PLA.\n\nGot a specific project in mind? I can tailor advice if you\u2019re printing something particular. Also, what printer are you using? Some handle PETG better than others.",
